                We’ve always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to
                aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements.
                But we lost all that. Or perhaps we’ve just forgotten that we are still pioneers. And we’ve barely begun. And that our greatest
                accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our destiny lies above us.
